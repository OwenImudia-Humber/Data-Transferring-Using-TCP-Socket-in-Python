# Data-Transferring-Using-TCP-Socket-in-Python
This project demonstrates a basic TCP client-server file transfer system written in Python. The server listens for a connection, receives a filename from the client, and sends back the file’s contents over a TCP socket. If the file does not exist, the server sends an error message instead.
